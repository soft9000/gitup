# GitUp 9000
Use github as a cross-computer clipboard.

## Backstory
I need to copy and paste much into "[AboutTime](https://github.com/soft9000/AboutTime)." So imagine my angst when a recent upgrade shut-down my ability to move data out of my 'Dev environment?

Necessity being the invention of 'Mother (or something like that) this morning I cobbled **GitUp 9000** together so we might use a safe, approved & ubiquitous way to copy & paste text between multiple computers.

Status: **TESTING SUCCESS.**

- Adding an `argparse` is on the "comming soon" list. (*)

Caring is what sharing ... does!

## zSupport?
If you want to support the effort, I seek no donations. Instead, simply feel free to purchase one of [my educational](https://www.udemy.com/user/randallnagy2/) or [printed](https://www.amazon.com/Randall-Nagy/e/B08ZJLH1VN?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1660050704&sr=8-1) productions?

(*) **CAVEATS:** Written for personal (read 'same-time-zone') usage. Support for multiple timezones simply requires using Zulu... Also on the to-do... 

I might even be-craft a Tkinter and / or a Qt GUI if folks like this project ... as usual, the power is YOURS?
